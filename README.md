# PoolSkimmer
Transforms an RC Boat to autonomous robotic pool skimmer!
----

The PoolSkimmer project takes a standard RC Boat (e.g. the <a href=http://www.nikkorc.com/products-category/boats> Nikko Sea Racer</a>)  and transforms it into a semi autonomous drone that can clean debris from a the top surface of a pool. This is an Arduino based project that uses standard motor controllers to take over the speed and direction of the boat. A sonic sensor is used to detect pool walls and ladders so the Pool Skimmer can chnage direction to avoid the object.
